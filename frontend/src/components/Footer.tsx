          1. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they purchase
          an eligible Mac or iPad at a Qualifying Location. Only one Apple Gift
          Card per eligible Mac or iPad per Qualified Purchaser. Offer subject
          to availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall
          receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the
          price of the eligible Mac or iPad, but will be charged for all items
          in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice
          regarding the checkout receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card
          Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified
          Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option) as payment type at
          checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the Apple Gift
          Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This will result in
          one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the eligible iPad or Mac
          discounted by the instant credit, and a second ACMI installment plan
          over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total
          combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans
          will reflect the original full retail price of the Eligible Product.
          Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the
          Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the
          eligible Mac or iPad. ACMI is subject to credit approval and credit
          limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from 12.49%
          to 23.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of July 1, 2022. If you
          choose the pay‑in‑full or one‑time‑payment option for an ACMI‑eligible
          purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout,
          that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your
          Apple Card. Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions
          and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card
          Customer Agreement at
          https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf
          for more information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online
